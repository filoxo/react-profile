## Resources

Here's a contrived list of resources that you can keep going with React.

- [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router): a complete routing library that syncs the UI with the URL. 
- [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux): a state container for React; the most popular implementation of FLUX but can be too advanced for beginners.
- [Egghead.io: Getting started with Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux): Dan Abramov, creator of Redux, goes in depth on how it was implemented and how it functions. And its free! (at the time of this writing)
- [Cubbie](https://github.com/samueleaton/cubbie): a simplified state container. Great for getting started quickly, and newbies. 
- [React Dev Tools](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/09/02/new-react-developer-tools.html): Dev tools available for Chrome and Firefox to allow you to debug your React code much better. 
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/): Are you in love with React? You can use the same syntax and feature set to create **native** mobile apps. 
- [React & Redux Cheatsheets](https://egghead.io/react-redux-cheatsheets): Prepared cheat sheets to remind you the basic syntax for React (ES5 only) and Redux.
- [React ES6 Cheatsheet](http://jamesknelson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/react-with-babel-cheatsheet.pdf): Shows the newer React component syntax using ES6 classes and `React.Component`.
